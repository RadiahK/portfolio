<h1> Reflections with Radiah </h1>
<p1> Learning a new language is a feat, but learning a new computer language is a task unparalled to any other language that I've ever had to learn. Today I learned the language called Python. The functions of python have some parallels to those of scratch, but with a bit more complexity. For example, the language consits of Booleans, Integers, Floats, and Strings. Using these new components, I created a couple shapes, including a triangle and a square, which ended up being quite an arduous task. I was initially inputting both coordinates and directions into my terminal;however, through trial and error, I soon learned that I can outline the parameter of a triangle, square, or any other object with a slight resemblance to a shape by either coding coordinates or directions.  </p1>
   
<h2> Reflections with Radiah Day 2 </h2>
<p2> Today we created a text adventure game using python. Being a mystery/crime enthusiast, the plot of my game was about a serial killer who
    intrudes into the user's home and tries to kill the user. However, the user has options in which he/she can defend themselves, by either 
    using their weapons or hiding. After this initial step, the user is subsequently followed by a series of other options to choose from and
    takes him/her on a text adventure with what can be a happy or eery ending. </p2>
  
 <h3> Reflections with Radiah Day 3 </h3>
 <p3> Refinery 29 is like buzzfeed, but catered specifically toward females. This social media hub features blog articles about today's 
    entertainment business, fashion, women's health, fitness, technology, and politics. The trip was fun and the environment was very friendly and relaxed- somewhere I'd like to work at. 
    Our activity coalsced the entrepreneurial aspects of business as well as how technology and computer science plays a major role in the 
    success of a company like Refinery 29. For example, the technicians, technology strategists, and computer scientists are in charge of bashing bugs,
    trolls who try to find leeways to plant bugs on forums and forms of the company, graphic design that accelerates readership of more articles, as 
    well as compartmentilzation and experimentation that needs to be done to off set a successful company. The trip was beneficial in the sense that
    it made me consider a career in business through the excercise that allowed us to pitch ideas about a recurring problem about a feature known as "Money Diaries".</p3>
  
  <h4> Reflections with Radiah Day 4 </h4>
  <p4> Today we used python to create 2 games: Guess the number Game and Roulette. Coding the Guess the number game was mind boggling at first, but after Eddy 
    showed it to us on the big screen, all the pieces of the code that I had scattered across my screen finally came into place. Next, came the code
    for Roullete. The game consits of a few basic rules and a whole lot of luck. Coding Roullete had similar features to game 1, but with a lot
    more lines of code. My partner, Claudia, and I got to code the first three levels of the game, which were guessing the color, guessing if
    the number is odd or even, and guessing the number. What we have yet to complete is dealing the money and features that subtract the money 
    based on the number of losses. Overall, the day was busy, but fun!</p4>
  
  <h5> Reflections with Radiah Day 5 </h5>
  <p5> I was excited for today's lesson because we started on a clean slate and delved into the field of robotics. I've learned that robotics is
    one of the caategories of computer science that I enjoy more, rather than just coding all day. I feel that the interactiveness and the liberty
    to wire robots is what makes me inquire more about the various different components. Today, we had 3 tasks: make a LED light up, make the LED blink,
    and make a traffic light. Some difficulties that I came across mainly involved hte positioning of the wires, resistors, and LEDS; however, after some 
    trial and error and a lot of internet surfing, we reigned victors! Moreover, some things that I felt more comfortable doing today, as a consequence
    of the practice that I've had from previous lessons, was coding the LEDs to actually light up. While the whole process took quite a bit of experimentation,
    it's a task that I was adamant to complete and get right. The feeling at the end when your creation works is what makes the arduous process worthwhile. </p5>
  
  <h6> Reflections with Radiah Day 6 </h6>
  <p6> Using the same skills we used yesterday to build a circuit that alloed to make an LED blink, we applied similar concepts
    today when building a robot that would have the LED light fade, have multiples LEDs blink in order, and our final one, the 
    photoelectric cell-which gave us quite a lot of difficulty- to light up based on integers. Basically, in the photoelectric cell, there 
    was a range of integers and the integers would indicdate the increasing levels of brightness. This took plenty of trial and error,
    but we finally, somewhat, got it to work at the end. </p6>
  
  <h7> Reflections with Radiah Day 7 </h7>
  <p7> Today's agenda included the planning of a Robot Dance Party!! Coding was surely a difficult process however, my team and I made
    it through thick and thin and was able to make the robot dance to my favorite song, at the moment, Unforgettable. After several attempts of
    trying to upload the url from youtube to piezo, we figured that it is physically impossible to do that, so we resorted to the melody of the star wars and mario cart. </p7>

  <h8> Reflections with Radiah Day 8 </h8>
  <p8> Building escapebot was honestly really fun today! Using the applications and code that we made yesterdau, we essentially just built on top
    of it. Therefore, after some hardware work, including wiring and whatnot, we proceeded to the escapebot code and essentially, coalsced the code
    from sensorknightrider with the code for the button robot. Our successful creation was very admirable at the end because the robot worked after
  we clicked on the cute, little red button! Subsequently, we added another sensor, known as whisker wires. The objective of these wires is
    to turn back if it encounters an obstacle that is not letting the robot go forward. Consequently, today's tasks were very engaging and we 
    created our first functioning robot named Becky!</p8>
