<h1> Reflections with Radiah </h1>
<p> Learning a new language is a feat, but learning a new computer language is a task unparalled to any other language that I've ever had to learn. Today I learned the language called Python. The functions of python have some parallel to those of scratch, but with a bit more complexity. For example, the languager consits of Booleans, Integers, Floats, and Strings. Using these new components, I created a couple shapes, including a triangle and a square, which ended up being quite an arduous task. I was initially inputting both coordinates and directions into my terminal;however, through trial and error, I soon learned that I can outline the parameter of a triangle, square, or any other object with a slight resemblance to a shape could be accomplished by either coding coordinates or directions.  </p>
