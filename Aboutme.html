<h1> Reflections with Radiah </h1>
<p1> Learning a new language is a feat, but learning a new computer language is a task unparalled to any other language that I've ever had to learn. Today I learned the language called Python. The functions of python have some parallels to those of scratch, but with a bit more complexity. For example, the language consits of Booleans, Integers, Floats, and Strings. Using these new components, I created a couple shapes, including a triangle and a square, which ended up being quite an arduous task. I was initially inputting both coordinates and directions into my terminal;however, through trial and error, I soon learned that I can outline the parameter of a triangle, square, or any other object with a slight resemblance to a shape by either coding coordinates or directions.  </p1>
  
<h2> Reflections with Radiah Part 2 </h2>
<p2> Today we created a text adventure game using python. Being a mystery/crime enthusiast, the plot of my game was about a serial killer who
    intrudes into the user's home and tries to kill the user. However, the user has options in which he/she can defend themselves, by either 
    using their weapons or hiding. After this initial step, the user is subsequently followed by a series of other options to choose from and
    takes him/her on a text adventure with what can be a happy or eery ending. </p2>
