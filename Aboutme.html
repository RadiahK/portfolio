<h1> Reflections with Radiah </h1>
<p1> Learning a new language is a feat, but learning a new computer language is a task unparalled to any other language that I've ever had to learn. Today I learned the language called Python. The functions of python have some parallels to those of scratch, but with a bit more complexity. For example, the language consits of Booleans, Integers, Floats, and Strings. Using these new components, I created a couple shapes, including a triangle and a square, which ended up being quite an arduous task. I was initially inputting both coordinates and directions into my terminal;however, through trial and error, I soon learned that I can outline the parameter of a triangle, square, or any other object with a slight resemblance to a shape by either coding coordinates or directions.  </p1>
   
<h2> Reflections with Radiah Day 2 </h2>
<p2> Today we created a text adventure game using python. Being a mystery/crime enthusiast, the plot of my game was about a serial killer who
    intrudes into the user's home and tries to kill the user. However, the user has options in which he/she can defend themselves, by either 
    using their weapons or hiding. After this initial step, the user is subsequently followed by a series of other options to choose from and
    takes him/her on a text adventure with what can be a happy or eery ending. </p2>
  
 <h3> Reflections with Radiah Day 3 </h3>
 <p3> Refinery 29 is like buzzfeed, but catered specifically toward females. This social media hub features blog articles about today's 
    entertainment business, fashion, women's health, fitness, technology, and politics. The trip was fun and the environment was very frinedly and relaxed- somewhere I'd like to work at. 
    Our activity coalsced the entrepreneurial aspects of business as well as how technology and computer science plays a major role in the 
    success of a company like Refinery 29. For example, the technicians, technology strategists, and computer scientists are in charge of bashing bugs,
    trolls who try to find leeways to plant bugs on forums and forms of the company, graphic design that accelerates readership of more articles, as 
    well as compartmentilzation and experimentation that needs to be done to off set a successful company. The trip was beneficial in the sense that
    it made me consider a career in business through the excercise that allowed us to pitch ideas about a recurring problem about a feature known as "Money Diaries".</p3>
